# Basic Data Types

***

## Numbers

### What are the basic arithmetic operators you can use on numbers?

> `+`, `-`, `*`, `**`, `/` & `%`

***
### What’s the difference between an integer and a float?

> Integers are round up numbers, while floats can represent numbers with decimal places. 

***
### What method would you use to convert a float to an integer?

> `to_i`

***
### What method would you use to convert an integer to a float?

> `to_f`

***
## Strings

### What is a string?

> It's a chain of characters.

***
### What are the differences between single and double quotes?

> The only difference is that with double quotes you can use interpolation and with singles you can't.

***
### What is string interpolation?

> It's ruby code inside a string, and the return value get's replaced on the same place where the interpolation is defined.

***
### How do you concatenate strings?

> With the `+` operator or `<<`. You could use the concat method too.

***
### What method would you use to change all the characters in your string to upper case?

> `upcase()`

***
### What method would you use to split up strings into arrays?

> `split(separator)`

***
### What are escape characters?

>  This are special characters which must be interpreted inside a string. They are preceded with `\`

***
### How do you access a specific character or substring?

> `substr()` or using the `[index]`, `[start..end]`, `[index, len]`

***
### How do you convert other data types into strings?

> `to_s`

***
## Symbols

### What is a symbol?

> It's a twist of the string concept, symbols can also represent string values, but they will be store only once and their value will never change.<br>
> In other words they will be stored in memory only once and will be faster to retrieve, useful for keys in a Hash.

***
### How do you create a symbol?

> Placing colons before the symbol name<br>
> `:this_is_a_symbol`

***
### What’s the difference between a symbol and a string?

> Strings are stored everytime you declare them. Symbols are stored only once.

***
## Booleans

### What does true represent?

> True.

***
### What does false represent?

> False.

***
### What does nil represent?

> Nothing(ness).
