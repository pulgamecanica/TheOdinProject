# Exercise 12 - Find the Oldest

Given an array of objects representing people with a birth and death year, return the oldest person.

Now that you've reached the final exercise, you should be fairly comfortable getting the information you need from test case(s). Take a look at how the array of objects is constructed in this exercise's test cases to help you write your function.

## Hints
- You should return the whole person object, but the tests mostly just check to make sure the name is correct.
- This can be done with a couple of chained array methods, or by using `reduce`.
- One of the tests checks for people with no death-date.. use JavaScript's Date function to get their age as of today.
