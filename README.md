# Knowledge check.

	You will find bellow my solution to all the knowledge checks I've done.

***

# How Does the Web Work?

***

### What is a web server?

> It's a computer, which can send messages to a web browser.<br>
> A web server hosts one or multiple websites which then are sent to any client who requests them.

***
### What is a network?

> A network is a set of connected computers.<br>
> The computers connected to the network can access shared resources and communicate with each other.

***
### What is the internet?

> The internet is a wire. Which allows the World Wide Web to works, thus we can communicate between computers!

***
### What is an IP address?

> It's a type of ID which helps the Internet send packets, and track the packet destiny. It's the address of each computer connected to the Internet.

***
### What is a router?

> It's a piece of software that helps the internet packets arrive to their destination, by redirecting them to the destiny.<br>
> Routers will add an extra layer of it's own IP to the packet, so when the packet must go back to it's sender.<br>
> The routers, can easily identify who they need to send it to.<br>

***
### What is an ISP?

> It's an Internet Service Provider, it helps clients (humans at their home, or at work for example) connect to the internet.

***
### What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?

> Packets containe data which is sent over the internet, not necesarilly all the data is contained in one packer<br>
> Many times the data gets split in order to allow the internet to handle traffic in a better way.<br>

***
### What is a client?

> A client is a computer, which sends a request to the internet, which later will translate to packets.

***
### What is a server?

> A server is a computer which provides the data requested by a client, this data might be a video, a webpage, a file; etc.

***
### What is a web page?

> A Web Page is a set of documents which are organized to reproduce a page.<br>
> The page it written usually in HTML, styled with CSS and it may contain media which is used by the same web page, this can be, a picture, video; etc.<br>
> A web page might also use JS to create more interactive resources, and to allow effects so the client has a more pleasant experience:<br>
> Like being able to pause a video, or to make a video louder or mute the vide, to open a pop-up and to close it; etc.

***
### What is a web browser?

***
### Which browser are you currently using?

> Arc with Chrome 117

***
### In your own words, explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.

> When you run a search on a search engine, such as google, your request will be sent to google.com server's IP address, which your web browser will try to find.<br>
> Sometimes web browsers know the IP address because they saved it on the computer memory.<br>
> If the DN (Domain Name) is not saved, the web browser will make a request to the DNS to get the website IP address.<br>
> Once it receives the IP address, it will negociate with google.com server to get a response, so the web browser will send your request.<br>
> The server receives your requests and sends back a response, which is composed of multiple packets, which get to you being routed around 10 - 15 times.<br>
> The search engine will return usually a web page containing results for your query, with links to the web pages corresponding to the query.

***

# Introduction to Git

***

### What kind of program is Git?

>It's a distributed version control system, or simply, the stupid content tracker.

*** 
### What are the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping?

> A text editor saves nothing but the contents of a file, only one entry exists for each file that the text editors is currently editing.<br>
> Git on the other hand, will keep a snapshot of many versions for a certain directory, on it's .git directory.<br>
> Git will save snapshots of the staged files and also, allow branching features.<br>

*** 

### Does Git work at a local or remote level?

> Both!!! Git allows you to publish your version to a network, and work with other clients on the same repository.<br>
> Git also keeps a local version of the project on each client that downloaded it's source.

***

### Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?

> GitHub works at a remote level only, it is a website that allows you to share your repositories on the internet.<br>
> GitHub features, Wiki's, bug trackers, project management tools and more.

***

### Why is Git useful for developers?

> It's useful to keep track of the different versions of a project.<br>
> It will also safeguard the information of the project, making the project more reliable.

***
### Why are Git and GitHub useful for a team of developers?

> Working with a team is more effective by using tools like Git, because you can make branches, and merge the code.<br>
> Git allows you to keep a version locally of the repository, which ultimately can save the project in case the main server is ever corrupted, or deleted by mistake.<br>
> GitHub offers project management tools, useful for teams, and creating issues, which can evolve to Pull Requests which evntually can get merge into the main branch.

***


# Git Basics

***

### How do you create a new repository on GitHub?

> You navigate to the repositories section and click "New",  then you choose the repository name and create it by summiting the form.

***

***
### Explain what origin is in git push origin main.

> **origin** is the target of the remote server. When you push, the git repository will be uploaded to the origin url.

***
### Explain what main is in git push origin main.

> _main_ is the branch on the remote server. The changes would be uploaded to that same branch.

***
### Explain the two-stage system that Git uses to save files.

> The staging area and the committed files.<br>
> The staging area is like a waiting room, the files that are stages are waiting to be committed.<br>
> When you commit all the files in the staging area will be saved in the distributed version control system, they will be safe!

***
### How do you check the status of your current repository?

> `git status`

***
### How do you add files to the staging area in git?

> With the `git add` + filename command, you can use `"."` to stage all the files, or `-p` to patch all the modified files.

***
### How do you commit the files in the staging area and add a descriptive message?

> `git commit -m "Your Message goes here"`

***
### How do you push your changes to your repository on GitHub?

> `git push name_of_your_remote name_of_the_branch`

***
### How do you look at the history of your previous commits?

> `git log`

***

***
### What is an attribute?

> It is an part of the tag that specifies a certain configuration of the element. Attributes might help you set up a reference, size, meta data; etc.

***
### What attribute tells links where to go to?

> The href attribute specifies the place where a link should go to, while the target attribute tells how to open that link.

***
### What security considerations must be taken if you wish to use the target attribute to open links in a new tab/window?

> Weather you want or not for the link to reference it's origin, and if you wish to give access to the page via the link.<br>
> It is recommended to not give access by setting up the attributes `rel="noopener noreferrer"`

***
### What is the difference between an absolute and relative link?

> An absolute link will not build the url with the current location. The url is exactly what the data on the document.<br>

- gif : Can be used for animations, it works for anything that a png could be used<br>
- svg: It's not a pixel-based image, it's vector based, which is great for scaling, since the image will never loose quality, using svg is usually better than using png<br>

***

# Commit Messages

***

### What are two benefits of having well-written commit messages and a good commit history?

> 1 - It's easier to navigate between versions, gives a better perspective to the project<br>
> 2 - It's more welcoming to fellow programmers, they can get a better sense of what is happening on the code and how it evolves<br>

***
### How many characters should the subject line of your commit message be?

***


# Intro to CSS

***
### What is the syntax for class and ID selectors?

> \#id-case-sensitive-name

***
### How would you apply a single rule to two different selectors?

> Using a coma separated list<br>
```
div, p {
  rule: value;
}
```

***
### Given an element that has an id of title and a class of primary, how would you use both attributes for a single rule?

>
```
.primary#title {
}
```

***
### What does the descendant combinator do?

> It will cause the last selector to be selected, this, is a selector which has the ancestors which are in place.

***
### What are the names of the three ways to add CSS to HTML?

> - *External CSS* (Linking)<br>
> - *Internal CSS* (Embedded)<br>
> - *Inline CSS* In-Place

***
### What are the main differences between the three ways of adding CSS to HTML?

> The External is the most useful because you can modify all the css in a single file. Specially useful when you have multiple pages.
> Internal is good when the style is _ONLY_ going to be used in that web page.
> Inline is usually a bad practice because it will doom the element forever, you would need to change directly the element, which can be painful when you have a big web page.

***


# The Cascade

***
### Between a rule that uses one class selector and a rule that uses three type selectors, which rule has the higher specificity?

> The rule that uses the class selector will always beat a type selector rule.

***

# Inspecting HTML and CSS

***

### How do you select a specific element on your page with your browser’s developer tools?

> You can either hover the node on the Elements section, or choose the hover tool and hover the element on the webpage.

***

### What does a strikethrough in a CSS declaration mean in your browser’s developer tools?

> That the CSS rule was overwritten.

***
### How do you change CSS in real time on specific elements of a web page with your browser’s developer tools?

> In the styling section, you can add styles or edit them, without needing to reload the page.

***

# The Box Model

***

### From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?

>  The element content, the padding, the border & the margin.

***
### What does the box-sizing CSS property do?

>  When we use box-sizing we can change how elements count the width and heigh properties, either taking into account also padding and border, on just the element size.

***
### What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?

> The standard box model will respect the height and width properties given, and apply them to the content box.<br>
> This is not always the best solution, since the box is define beyond the content, including the border and padding.<br>
> So a box might be bigger than what you would expect. You can change this behavior by altering the box model.<br>
> Then the height and width attributes will define the box size, including the border and padding, and the content will grow in order to fill the values given.

***
### Would you use margin or padding to create more space between 2 elements?

> `margin`

***
### Would you use margin or padding to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?

> `padding`

***
### Would you use margin or padding if you wanted two elements to overlap each other?

> `margin, with a negative value`

***
### How do you set the alternative box model for all of your elements?

>  
```
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;`
}
```

***
### How do you center an element horizontally?

> By defining a width and using `margin: 0 auto;` or `margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;` the element will center horizontally.

***

# Block and Inline

***
### What is the difference between a block element and an inline element?

> A block element will take all the inline space available of the parent when no width or height are defined and cause other elements to move away from it.<br>
> An inline element doesn't respect the width and height attributes, and will not cause elements to move away from it, it will take just the space it requires.

***
### What is the difference between an inline element and an inline-block element?

> An inline element doesn't respect the margin, or border attributes, nor the height or width, while inline-block will indeed respect this attributes.

***
### Is an h1 block or inline?

> `block`

***
### Is button block or inline?

> `inline`

***
### Is div block or inline?

> `block`

***
### Is span block or inline?

> `inline`

***

# Introduction to Flexbox

***

### What’s the difference between a flex container and a flex item?

> A flex container has the property display flex.<br>
> A flex item is any children of an element which contains the display flex property.<br>
> This concepts are not exclusive, and a flex container can also be a flex item.<br>

***
### How do you create a flex item?

> Any children of an element with display flex, will automatically become a flex item.

***

# Growing and Shrinking

***

### What are the 3 values defined in the shorthand flex property (e.g. flex: 1 1 auto)?

> `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` & `flex-basis`

***
### What are the 3 defined values for the flex shorthand flex:auto?

> `flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: auto`

***

# Axes

***

### How do you make flex items arrange themselves vertically instead of horizontally?

> `flex-direction: column;`

***
### In a column flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?

> To the initial *height* of the flex-item.

***
### In a row flex-container, what does flex-basis refer to?

> To the initial *width* of the flex-item.

***
### Why do the previous two questions have different answers?

> Because the flex-direction influences the flex-grow property, thus changing it's meaning.<br>
> It makes sense, since you want the direction to change accordingly the properties.

***

# Alignment

***

### What is the difference between justify-content and align-items?

> Justify-content will distribute the items in the same direction of the flex-direction property: horizontally or vertically.<br>
> Align-items will distribute the items in the opposite direction which flex-direction has.

***
### How do you use flexbox to completely center a div inside a flex container?

> `justify-content: center; align-items: center;`

***
### What’s the difference between justify-content: space-between and justify-content: space-around?

> Space around will distribute all elements evenly using all the available space.<br>
> Space between will distribute all elements using all the available space towards the center, with items on both start and end.

***

# Fundamentals Part 1

***
### Name the three ways to declare a variable

> `var name` , `let name` & `const name` in non strict environments, just declaring a name will work `name`.

***
### Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?

> The `var` because it's the old way to declaring variables and it may behave unexpectedly.

***
### What rules should you follow when naming variables?

> Giving the variables meaningful names, avoid generic or random short names.<br>
> A good variable name helps readability and understanding the code better.

***
### What happens when you add numbers and strings together?

> Both operands will be converted to string, no matter the order.

***
### How does the Modulo (%), or Remainder, operator work?

> It will return the value which reminds after a division with the given operand on the left side.

***
### Explain the difference between == and ===.

> The strict comparator `===`, will also evaluate the object type as well, while the "normal" `== ` operator will only evaluate it's value.

***
### When would you receive a NaN result?

> When the conversion is impossible, the result will be NaN (not a number)

***
### How do you increment and decrement a number?

> You can use the `++` & `--` operators to increment or decrement one. Or if you prefer to use a certain amount  `+= amount` & `-= amount`

***
### Explain the difference between prefixing and postfixing increment/decrement operators.

> The pre-fixing `++num --num` will return the value *after* the operation was done.<br>
> The post-fixing `num++ num--` will return the value *before* the operation was completed.

***
### What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?

> Each operator has a precedence index value, which help JS evaluate which operations to do first.
> When the precedence is the same, the operation in done from left to right.

***
### How do you access developer tools and the console?

> Opening the Inspector option after right click. Then opening the "Console" tab on the developers tools menu.

***
### How do you log information to the console?

> `console.log(arguments, ...);`

***
### What does unary plus operator do to string representations of integers? eg. +”10”

> It will cast the string to a base 10 number value, it will assume the Number type.

***
# Fundamentals Part 2

***
### What are the eight data types in JavaScript?

> `Number`, `BigInt`, `String`, `null`, `undefined`, `boolean`, `Objects` & `Symbols`

***
### Which data type is NOT primitive?

> `Objects` & `Symbols`

***
### What is the relationship between null and undefined?

> `null` & `undefined` are both falsy, they both indicate absence of a value, but in different contexts.<br>
> `null` indicates that a value is empty or unknown.<br>
> `undefined` indicates an uninitialized value not yet assigned.

***
### What is the difference between single, double, and backtick quotes for strings?

> Single and double quotes are essentially the same thing.<br>
> With backtick you can embed strings inside, and declare multi-line strings.<br>

***
### What is the term for joining strings together?

> "concatenation"

***
### Which type of quote lets you embed variables/expressions in a string?

> Backtick quotes.

***
### How do you embed variables/expressions in a string?

> Using: `${...}`

***
### How do you use escape characters in a string?

> Sometimes you want some characters to be consider text not special code characters like " or '.<br>
> Use a backslash before the character to indicate they should be considered as text: ```"Quotes: (\") are fun!"```

***
### What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?

> Slice will take as parameters the start and end of the string which will be extracted and returned.<br>
> Substring behaves just like slice, but any value < 0 will be considered as zero.<br>
> Substr will take as arguments the start of the string and the length of the string to be extracted.<br>
> Any of these methods when only one parameter is given, will return the string, sliced, up until the last character.

***
### What are the three logical operators, and what do they stand for?

> OR `||`, AND `&&` & NOT `!`

### What are the comparison operators?

> `>` greater than, `<` lower than, `==` equals & `!=` different<br>
> You can also combine the first two with the third:<br>
> - `>=` greater or equals than<br>
> - `<=` lower or equals than

***
### What are truthy and falsy values?

> It the overall result of the evaluation of an expression. They represent the boolean True & False.

***
### What are the falsy values in JavaScript?

> These are values that will evaluate to false. `null`, `undefined`, `""` (empty string), `NaN` & 0.

***
### What are conditionals?

> This are evaluations which control the flow of our code. Depending on the result something can or cannot happen.
> There are keywords to simplify and improve readability on the code => `if`, `else`, `else if`, `?`, `:`, `switch` & `case`.

***
### What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?

>
```js
if (boolean resulting expression) {
  console.log("This will execute when true");
} else {
  console.log("This will execute when false");
}
```

***
### What is the syntax for a switch statement?

>
```js
switch (value) {
  case (expression to be compared with ===):
    console.log("Executed when the case is true");
    [break];
  default:
   console.log("The default statement");
}
```
***
### What is the syntax for a ternary operator?

>
```js
let val = (expression) ? "return this when expression true" : "This value when false";
```

***
### What is nesting?

> It's when you put conditions inside other conditions. Which is perfectly OK!

# JavaScript Developer Tools

***
### How do you open developer tools?

> From the Chrome Menu > More Tools > Developer Tools<br>
> You can also right click and go to Inspect.<br>
> Use the keyboard shortcut F12 or Ctrl + Shift + C (Mac: Opt + Cmd

***
### How do you change screen size of a website using developer tools?

> Click Toggle Device Toolbar on the developer tools menu. You can choose a device view port or resize responsively. 

***
### What is a breakpoint?

> It is a tool that helps you debug your code, by setting a position where the code will stop (pause).

***
### How do you set a breakpoint?

> By opening the menu Event Listener Breakpoints, or by clicking on the line left side. 

***

# Fundamentals Part 3

***
### What are functions useful for?

> To reuse blocks of code and to modularize our programs, making them more readable and less repetitive.

***
### How do you invoke a function?

> By calling it's name, followed by parenthesis `()` you can provide arguments if needed, separated by comas..

***
### What are anonymous functions?

> This are functions without names, useful when you need to pass a function as an argument.<br>
>
```js
function thisFunctionTakesAFunctionAsParameter(myCustomFunction) {
  myCustomFunction();
}
thisFunctionTakesAFunctionAsParameter(function () { alert("HelloWorld") });
```

***
### What is function scope?

> This is the block where your local variables will be available. A scope is defined with brackets `{ ...scope...}`.

***
### What are return values?

> It's the value which a function returns, it's defined with the `return` keyword followed bby the value to be returned.

***
### What are arrow functions?

> It's another way to create functions, useful to define a one-line function, since it doesn't need an explicit return when it's only one line.<br>
> They are defined like so:<br>
>
```js
(value) => value;
```
> Which can translate to<br>
>
```js
(function (value) {
  return (value);
});
```
> Arrow functions can also define a scope, but in those cases it's common to loose their ability to implicitly return, because it would have more than one line.

# Problem Solving

***

### What are the three stages in the problem solving process?

> Identifying the input, Visualizing the output, suggesting a pseudocode with your logic.

***
### Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?

> In order to identify which variables you are going to need. And how you can solve the problem in the most effective way.

***
### What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?

> Divide and conquest. Divide the problem into smaller tasks.

***
### What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?

> Pseudo Code. 

***
### What is an algorithm?

> It's the steps which a program will take when solving a problem. This steps might vary on conditions.

***
### What is pseudocode?

> It's the code but in written language, in order to explain the code in a more "familiar" way.

***
### What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

> It's easier to solve small problems instead of bigger problems.

***

# Understanding Errors

***

### What are three reasons why you may see a TypeError?

> ReferenceError, it happens when you try to reference (use, invoke) something which is not known to the program.<br>
> SyntaxError, when you type something that doesn't exists on the ECMA syntax rules.<br>
> TypeError, it's when you try to reference something that doesn't belong to that type (incompatible).

***
### What is the key difference between an error and a warning?

> Errors stop the execution of your program, while warning only point out that something might not be ok.

***
### What is one method you can use to resolve an error?

> Explore the error trace, use the developer's tools, place console.trace or console.log on your code; etc.
